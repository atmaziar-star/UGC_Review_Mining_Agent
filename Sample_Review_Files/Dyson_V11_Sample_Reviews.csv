This vacuum is perfect for pets or a busy household. Extremely easy, light weight picks up hair, dirt, easily and the battery power is good. The suction head is powerful, versatile, and flexible to get under furniture without moving it. The attachment is great for the stairs and furniture. In a house with all women in the family, there is a lot of hair and it does not get tangled in the roller. This makes vacuuming seem like not a chore.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PsP28uTcL._SL1000.jpg

Read that as I have contractors walking down a dirt driveway (muddy in rain) into the house carrying all manner of power tools and product. The whole house is either hardwood floor or tile with a set of stairs. Estimate 1800 -> 2000 square feet and the contractors are in every square foot of this place. Plumbing, electric, carpentry, you name it... it's all ending up on the floor.

The V11 is awesome, I have shown it absolutely no mercy, this thing has been taking an absolute beating picking up rocks and dirt from the driveway, all types of wire clippings, wood chips sheet rock dust, packing material, you name it... if it's on the floor, it's in the dirt catcher of the V11. I probably should be using a shop vac.

The power head works extremely well on both the entry way rugs that take the first steps from the driveway into the house as well as the hardwood without having to change a power head. I either use the powerhead or the brush attachment on the stairs, depending on how bad they are.

I easily get through the whole house on a full charge, and that includes spending time on those entry way matts, and there is still some juice left.

My wife has an issue with the weight of it for a full house cleaning, it's a bit heavy for her for that length of time, but she loves the way it works when she is just doing a couple of rooms or areas at a clip and now wants one for our primary residence.

The wall hanger it comes with is useful; the hanger is both a charging station and attachment caddy in one. Odd, they don't provide a space for the small power head that comes with the vacuum.

As mentioned, the device has some weight and when you set it into the wall hanger, that weight transfers right to the screws holding it to the wall hanger to the wall, making the drywall anchors that come with the wall hanger insufficient. You need to hit a stud with the screws or use a Molly or Toggle anchor if you expect that wall hanger to stay on the wall.

It could use a headlamp on the power head, that would really be a good feature to add.

Overall, a must buy!!",,https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Origin-Cordless-Vacuum-Nickel/dp/B00FZPRUTY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=SOUX5UBXI5EN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g3vpa3pw8uT2n-Iy-gNjTfH09ISfCLuJtT5_x-8VuZ8fMfZPsUUaFDpaIMifHEVi0HT0ruPAuG7LgdvpZXIfPNdVrWo5dUHkwxCiXN3B2-r7MkHwfduNiTl3Aed6S3GsIA0adCc-W1BJz0uFgxY-Wj6o7XFTb-WmxXcRiR3rooj5NevAit0M19yp3YhTwlLPIx_dePQFQwwY4rb2_sRtRT4IAB_7v_2Zyq8KuYurBZqza2F0KVPhhjBa9EF89Vx5LB4MN-IS0eUcPFK7GGy9En1e2r5OWUT_sS0tCw76Kqk.eCmjB1i78CAwvDJKdMrndHywG29pSeVzYiYK04NSxvU&dib_tag=se&keywords=dyson&qid=1768774758&sprefix=dyson%2Caps%2C259&sr=8-6&th=1

I had been using an older Dyson version for years until it started only staying on for about 8 minutes. I invested in a newer model, and wow, am I happy with it! This model runs for up to 60 minutes.

It works on wood floors and transitions immediately to rugs without a problem. My old vac just couldn't work on most rugs. The swivel head is even more flexible, making getting into and around corners so easy. The release to empty the dirt canister is also much improved. It's obvious how to empty it.

I thought it was the pinnacle of cordless vacuuming. Then it broke. After more research than most sane people would commit to, I came to the realization that I had a corded Dyson in perfect condition that's over 10 years old. And the V11 reviews really well. So well that the extra bells and whistles on the V15 aren't really worth the additional cost.

The suction on this thing is crazy. I have no problem getting through a 2800 sq ft home on a single charge. Honestly though, that was a test. More than likely, I'm just going to clean a section at a time as needed. Also, the bin is great capacity and holds all the cat fur and wife hair that it can find. It's top heavy, so at first it was slightly awkward getting used to detaching the extension to empty the bin, but you get used to it.

Better than my 3 other vacs combined.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2025",Verified Purchase,"I am not one to hock products online, and, even with a 30% off Prime Day deal, it wasn’t cheap for a light-weight stick vacuum ($399), but, holy smokes, do I love my new cordless Dyson V11. I hate vacuuming, but I also hate visible dirt , crumbs, and dust on our rugs and floors. My family would tell you I’m a bit obsessive about it - and very annoying to them, I’m sure. To ease my stress, I invested in a self-emptying Roomba earlier this year (I wrote about that, too), with the intention of running it every other day or so. This was a reasonable solution and has been generally helpful. But I don’t remember to do it often enough, it is very slow, it scares the cat, and it doesn’t give a deep clean on our wool rugs. And when there’s a small mess, it doesn’t work to say, “Google, tell the Roomba to vacuum only the rug in the living room.” But I’ve mainly been relying on “Roberto” once a week or so, followed by a deep clean by our house cleaner once a month. She came just 2 days ago and vacuumed, swept, and mopped the whole house (using her sturdy Oreck vacuum on the rugs). God bless that woman.

But I noticed a bit of a mess on one of the rugs today, so I whipped out the brand new Dyson, which was not fully charged, to try it out. I started with the front door mat, ‘cause I was there, and it immediately got that black mat perfectly clean - something it hasn’t been since its first day, because it’s ultra-grippy and resists the suction of all other vacuums. Then I vacuumed our heavy wool black-and-cream hallway rug that tends to get bits embedded in the weave. Perfect. Then I did the 20+ year old black botanical patterned wool living room rug, which came out looking better than it has in years, and didn’t require using additional tools (e.g. a Birkenstock) to scrape up the cat fur. Without making any adjustments, I then ran it over all the hard floors on the first floor, including the thick foam kitchen anti-fatigue mat, none of which had no real visible dirt or dust apart from the odd stray crumb or litter bead. It was super quick, and easy. Definitely heavier than my old corded stick vacuum, but not uncomfortable. And I found that cordless was a much bigger convenience than I’d anticipated. I realized that I used the prior stick vac so seldom in part because I hated wrangling with the cord, unwrapping, wrapping, plugging in here and there, etc. Yes, I’m lazy when it comes to vacuuming. In any case, doing most of the first floor of our house (about 7-800SF - I admit I didn’t do the nooks and crannies or move all the furniture) took me only a few minutes and the best (or worst?) part was that this small area, which was basically “clean” to start with, filled half of the canister with dust, fur and debris I hadn’t seen. Like a LOT. Yikes.

I’ve now given away our two other (non-robotic) vacuums. The first was a massive Dyson upright that I bought used several years ago that was powerful but so heavy and hard to maneuver that we seldom used it. The other was a corded Shark stick vac that was lightweight and did well reaching under furniture and for all kinds of other uses (furniture, drapes, ceiling cobwebs, etc.), but was not as powerful as we needed for regular jobs. And lately, it had started dumping a little pile of dirt at the end of each use that needed to be swept up. My new Dyson is the perfect alternative.

I hate waste and truly believe when buying something make sure to use it until it doesn’t work. My old one we replaced the battery twice and moved all around the US with it! I knew be a returning customer to Dyson this new investment would not disappoint! I hope she last as long as the 7ish years i had of the last!

LOVE it has a timer on each of the THREE levels!
HUGE waste bin compared to the old!
SO MUCH lighter than my old one shockingly!!

Only weird thing is the wall mount and battery really stick far off the wall and the charging cord is a lot less in length compared to the old one. We had to mount it in our garage since it extends so so so far off the wall mount and and in my home we didn’t have the best spot for it.

The prior two different makes of cordless vacs saw me having to clean the power head frequently. The wall bracket for hanging it up and charging works really well. My wife is quite small and at first didn't like having to keep pressure over the On trigger, but now says it's easy to do and doesn't bother her at all. Easy to empty once you're accustomed to it although sometimes, you do have to manually reach into the canister to pull hair out. That would be the only potential ""negative"" I could mention.

I've had a rather bulky, regular vacuum for awhile, but my house doesn't have a lot of space to maneuver in. So, we saved up and got this guy. I'll be honest, I didn't follow the directions. I took it out of the box and immediately wanted to see if it could handle my house full of cat and rabbit hair. Well, I looked at the handle and it said to charge it fully before first use... After I had used it for 20 minutes. It wasn't really picking anything up after a bit. The container was full, so I emptied it, but it still wouldn't pick anything up. I let it charge, thinking that's all it was, but then after several hours, it still wasn't picking up. I thought, ""great, I broke it after 20 minutes!"" Nope, I just didn't follow the directions. You have to pick a language on the handle screen first, and then it'll let you change the power setting. I realized that I had clogged it with all the hair and shredded rope toys keeping it on the middle strength setting, so I spent a while trying to pull it all out. After I found out about the power settings, though, I cranked it up to max (it only has 3 settings) and WOW what a difference!! It picks up absolutely everything.

I know some reviews talk about how bad it is that it has a pull trigger to turn it on instead of a switch, but this is actually a plus for me. My house has a bunch of cords and such all over the floor around the TV and my computer. Being able to just release the handle and move them, or release the handle when it starts to suck up something it shouldn't, is absolutely wonderful. Thankfully, it doesn't really try to eat cords. What it does suck up doesn't get wrapped around the roller, either. It's still sparkling clean despite all the hair, fuzzies, and pieces of rope toys I picked up with it. This is awesome, because with a traditional vacuum, I would spend quite a bit of time just cutting the hair off the roller.

All around, this is my new favorite household appliance. I actually enjoy sweeping with this thing! I used to have to sweep my faux hardwoods with a broom, which... Well, brooms really don't get the small stuff up. My house has never been cleaner! It still feels clean a week later. There are some places I still need to go through with the smaller hose attachments, like between cabinets, but overall just the regular sweeper head does a bang-up job!

Even the Dyyson label rated it ""B-Grade"" (see pic), but they labeled it ""mint"" in the posting. Tube had a dent, screen looked used, someone's dust was in the bin. I honestly wouldn't even mind if the unit worked- but I wasn't even allowed to return it without being first required to engage the vendor for support. After a couple of days of support, I insisted on returning the unit. They offered to ship me a replacement battery, but I did not sign-up to purchase a non-working unit and spend days waiting for spare parts troubleshooting with no guarantee that would even work. When you buy something refurbished in ""mint condition,"" you expect it to work right out of the box. You don't expect to receive a non-working unit that even the most minimal QC would have noticed if the unit in question had indeed gone through QC (it is my personal opinion that it didn't). In any event, after a few days of back and forth they eventually did authorize the return, so I bumped them up to 4-stars because of the inconvenience. As far as the product goes- it's a Dyson! Of course it's an amazing product! I think their refurbished department needs to do a better job ensuring the products they sell reflect reality (B-Grade is not Mint), prevent avoidable inconveniences to their customers. Overall, one bad experience will not deter me from using this brand, but I'll definitely think twice before buying ""used"" next time regardless of the brand.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TJXKudBGL._SL1000.jpg

Background. Started a business years ago as a janitor and cleaned Shell Oil business offices. Graduated from Dental school and spent 40 years doing the office cleaning with my staff as a means of office quality control.
I’ve had a LOT of vacuum cleaners of all shapes and sizes.
Dyson is quality. It is not however any more powerful on tile floor crumbs than a previous discount model we used.
Good suction, but doesn’t pick up the crumbs head on. It’s necessary to slightly lift the unit so the crumb is contained in the suction zone.
Canisters and uprights with cords are far superior.
Also for some unexplained reason there is no trigger lock. It amazes me that a company that prides itself on the physics of air movement would overlook such a simple convenience feature.

Hall,"Great second vacuum, but not perfect",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023",Verified Purchase,"Let me start off my saying this isn't my primary vacuum. For that, I have a Miele C2+. However, that can be hard to maneuver and is a burden for small, quick messes or cleaning between deep vacuuming. Also second disclosure, I've only used this on its default setting of ""medium"" so anything I mention about battery life will not discuss the different power settings.

So with that said, the Dyson V11 is a good addition to the fleet and a good second vacuum. I have a smallish house so I could see vacuuming maybe half of it on medium power; most of the house is carpet, though, so I don't think using the light setting would get things clean enough. With two dogs that both shed a decent amount, I usually fill the canister to its ""max fill"" line every time I vacuum so keep that in mind if you have shedding pets. Could you theoretically jam more in there before emptying it? Absolutely. However, I don't know if that would cause damage or just make emptying the bin that much harder. Now, because I mentioned the bin, let's move on to that. Overall, it's pretty easy to empty: pull off whatever attachment you're using, point the end over a trashcan, and engage the red lever on the bottom of the bin. Simple, right? Well, not so fast: remember how I said I have dogs? Yeah, their fur and my wife's long hair both tend to get stuck on I'm not even sure what, meaning I have to reach in and pull out part of whatever is in the bin. Most of it slides out easily, but not everything as Dyson's advertising claims. I have a much older Dyson stick vac, maybe first or second gen (doesn't really work much anymore), and the V11 is definitely easier to empty. Just not as ""point and shoot"" as Dyson would have you believe. Maybe if you don't have pets or long hair.

I like how on this generation of stick vac, the power head actually has a motor in it. My old one spun the carpet beater on the vacuum's suction, which caused it to stop quite frequently. The downside is that it doesn't have a mode where you're not running the beater, like on hard floors. This doesn't really bother me much because my hard floors consist of peel-and-stick tiles and laminate ""wood."" I'm not sure if the beater could scratch read wood floors, but I doubt it. From what I've been able to observe, nothing seems to get wound around the beater; it's well-designed in that way. Maybe the errant long thread/string from something, but hairs and such at least don't get wrapped around it. Another downside to the carpet head is that when the beater knocks around things that for whatever reason don't get sucked up, it gets spewed around the room. My Miele includes a rubber bar to minimize this from happening: it's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.

As far as maneuverability and weight, both are pretty solid, much better than my canister vac and easy for my kids to use (both kids are under 11). It's not quite as easy to maneuver the power head as I'd like, but it's much better than the old one I have. I'd hoped it would be a bit lighter than it is, but I guess I would've needed to step up a few models to the V15 my parents have to get it lighter (wasn't about to pay over $700 for a ""second"" vacuum).

The other attachments that accompany the vacuum seem good, but I haven't used them. The two crevice-like tools (one is a proper crevice tool) are pretty standard. There's also a smaller motor brush I could envision using on stairs, a couch, or in a car, but I've used the regular floor tool on my stairs with no issue, but each staircase has at most 6 stairs so that's easier than if I had a bigger staircase.

Overall, I feel like the Dyson V11 is a good buy. I bought this on sale during Black Friday for maybe $350US. I'm not sure off the top of my head what it's regular cost is, but anything more than what I paid would eat into its value proposition.",,https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Origin-Cordless-Vacuum-Nickel/dp/B00FZPRUTY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=SOUX5UBXI5EN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g3vpa3pw8uT2n-Iy-gNjTfH09ISfCLuJtT5_x-8VuZ8fMfZPsUUaFDpaIMifHEVi0HT0ruPAuG7LgdvpZXIfPNdVrWo5dUHkwxCiXN3B2-r7MkHwfduNiTl3Aed6S3GsIA0adCc-W1BJz0uFgxY-Wj6o7XFTb-WmxXcRiR3rooj5NevAit0M19yp3YhTwlLPIx_dePQFQwwY4rb2_sRtRT4IAB_7v_2Zyq8KuYurBZqza2F0KVPhhjBa9EF89Vx5LB4MN-IS0eUcPFK7GGy9En1e2r5OWUT_sS0tCw76Kqk.eCmjB1i78CAwvDJKdMrndHywG29pSeVzYiYK04NSxvU&dib_tag=se&keywords=dyson&qid=1768774758&sprefix=dyson%2Caps%2C259&sr=8-6&th=1

I’ve used it for a couple weeks now, and I HAVE NOTES.

• The important bit: It sucks. The vacuum’s suction is very good. Especially compared to my old Rocket. (I cleaned and maintained the filters on the old vacuum, but it could not provide the suction the V11 does.)
•Packaging: Oh my god, so much packaging! It’s a Russian nesting doll of packaging. The vacuum itself is inside a box which is inside another box which is inside a shipping box. But wait… inside that last box? More boxes! Every single piece and attachment is packed inside its own box or nestles in an intricate support structure of cardboard. I mean, the pieces surely aren’t going to get damaged, but …so much packaging.
• The Battery: Good new and bad news. It’s convenient to not have to stop to plug the old corded Rocket into a different outlet 4-5 times during vacuuming. The charging stand the V11 comes with makes it easy to recharge (if you can locate the stand near an outlet for the charging cord). HOWEVER, you get about 25 minutes of vacuuming time (at the recommended, medium power setting) on a full charge. For a four bedroom family home, that is not going to be enough! I’d rather have to move a cord and get it done all in one go. Recharge time is a couple hours.
• The ""Motorbar cleaning head"" (the brush roller), designed to not get tangled with hair and string, works like a charm. I normally vacuum up a lot of long hair and dental floss, but not a strand stuck in the V11’s roller.
• The handle: The design of the handle is unexpectedly not ergonomical. Being aligned at 90 degrees to the shaft makes the V11 more difficult to push *forward* as your hand is naturally pushing more towards the floor. More importantly, there is a seam in the plastic casing of the vacuum body right above the trigger. The top of your finger will rub against this seam constantly. It will rub a sore on top of your finger.
• The trigger: Some people have complained about having to hold down the trigger to keep the vacuum running. I expected to have a problem with this, but I didn’t. Just holding the V11 in a normal way rests your finger on the trigger during use, and it’s so sensitive that I seldom release it accidentally. (The sensitivity is actually almost a problem, I sometimes accidentally trigger the vacuum just handling it.)
• Length: It’s important. The grip of the V11’s handle is about 40"" from the floor. The handle of my old Rocket was 42"". As a 6’2"" older person, I have to bend a little more than I like to vacuum with the V11. Most people probably won’t have that problem.
• Other notes: Because of physics, dust spinning around the inside of the plastic canister generates static electricity. If you touch the plastic casing during operation, you can get a little shock. Also, when removing the shaft and brush head to empty the dust canister, the shaft/head won’t stand up by itself for you (something my old Rocket would do), it just falls over.

In conclusion, I kind of wish my old Rocket still did the job, but at the end of the day, the Dyson V11 has superior vacuuming capability, and that’s what you need. It has some pleasant features and some mildly annoying drawbacks, but it’s worth the holiday price.",,https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Origin-Cordless-Vacuum-Nickel/dp/B00FZPRUTY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=SOUX5UBXI5EN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g3vpa3pw8uT2n-Iy-gNjTfH09ISfCLuJtT5_x-8VuZ8fMfZPsUUaFDpaIMifHEVi0HT0ruPAuG7LgdvpZXIfPNdVrWo5dUHkwxCiXN3B2-r7MkHwfduNiTl3Aed6S3GsIA0adCc-W1BJz0uFgxY-Wj6o7XFTb-WmxXcRiR3rooj5NevAit0M19yp3YhTwlLPIx_dePQFQwwY4rb2_sRtRT4IAB_7v_2Zyq8KuYurBZqza2F0KVPhhjBa9EF89Vx5LB4MN-IS0eUcPFK7GGy9En1e2r5OWUT_sS0tCw76Kqk.eCmjB1i78CAwvDJKdMrndHywG29pSeVzYiYK04NSxvU&dib_tag=se&keywords=dyson&qid=1768774758&sprefix=dyson%2Caps%2C259&sr=8-6&th=1

This is a very smart device and has a lot of uses, definitely more than I know what to do with. The detachable vacuum converting it to a hand vac is really nice. I will say though that how it counts particles I have no idea, but you will see them, if you are a child of the 80s and are addicted to the ""high score"" mentality.

This vacuum really packs a punch, it works great on hardwood as well as carpet and I don't even need to transition it. It has a ton of attachments for about anything and it's not heavy or hard to move around except when it is deeply cleaning something. It's a manageable size too.

So, a lot of great things to say, but there are some glaring bad ones. Really, I didn't have the heart to give this 3 stars because of how well it otherwise works.

The bad: The attachments they give, some just don't seem to work like on their videos, for example the car. But that leads me to the videos, which really are the worst part of this vacuum. For a cleaning idiot like me, the videos are short and really explain nothing. They are made for people who already know and just give images for the most part what to do. They should explain things, and their app is trash for this. They should offer this on a much bigger screen with more detail.

Overall, a worth it vacuum, the battery also does our whole house well and could probably do 3 whole cycles in our home on one charge.",,https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Origin-Cordless-Vacuum-Nickel/dp/B00FZPRUTY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=SOUX5UBXI5EN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g3vpa3pw8uT2n-Iy-gNjTfH09ISfCLuJtT5_x-8VuZ8fMfZPsUUaFDpaIMifHEVi0HT0ruPAuG7LgdvpZXIfPNdVrWo5dUHkwxCiXN3B2-r7MkHwfduNiTl3Aed6S3GsIA0adCc-W1BJz0uFgxY-Wj6o7XFTb-WmxXcRiR3rooj5NevAit0M19yp3YhTwlLPIx_dePQFQwwY4rb2_sRtRT4IAB_7v_2Zyq8KuYurBZqza2F0KVPhhjBa9EF89Vx5LB4MN-IS0eUcPFK7GGy9En1e2r5OWUT_sS0tCw76Kqk.eCmjB1i78CAwvDJKdMrndHywG29pSeVzYiYK04NSxvU&dib_tag=se&keywords=dyson&qid=1768774758&sprefix=dyson%2Caps%2C259&sr=8-6&th=1

The v11 does seem to have a bit more power, and suction was amazing. So good, in fact, that it sucked up my washable rugs enough to stop the rotator. This is a problem, because even set at the weakest suction, it was still pulling too hard on the thinner rugs.
The unit is also quite a bit heavier than the v10, so this may be an issue if you have weakness or arthritis, which I do. I found that my arm got fatigued much faster with the v11. This is most likely due to the computer chip and fancy digital readout on the new unit. There was nothing wrong with the manual buttons on the older unit, but I guess everyone needs smart everything these days. In the future, I will probably opt for a factory-refurbished v10 to save on arm fatigue.
My plan was to put the older v10 in my motor home, and keep the new v11 in the house, but I think now after using them, I will switch that. The older one handles the rugs in the house better, and the new one will be better at sand tracked into the motorhome at the beach. All in all, an excellent unit, but I do wish it was a bit lighter, and a bit better on the thinner rugs. And of course, they take two different filters. Ah well....

Smith,"A few drawbacks, but overall a good vacuum",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2024",Verified Purchase,"I've just had this a week and it suctions well and is lightweight. Also, very maneuverable. So, it works well as a vacuum cleaner on both carpeted and hard surfaces (use the ""MED"" setting). The battery stayed charged for a whole hour or more. It's very convenient for vacuuming and I don't want to return it, but it has some surprising drawbacks due to poor planning in my opinion.

Here are the drawbacks.
1. There is NO on/off switch. As long as the battery is attached, if you barely touch the trigger the motor turns on, and it's extremely easy to touch the trigger without meaning to. So you must learn to be careful when holding it or carrying it.
2. This device is packaged with a LOT of cardboard boxes folded into various shapes to hold the components. I mean, there must have been ten or fifteen of these, which I flattened so I could recycle them. You have to see it to believe it. It's environmentally friendly, but very cumbersome to unpackage and dispose of all that cardboard.
3. You get a single sheet with a diagram that explains how to assemble it, but there are very few words and the diagrams are not detailed enough in some cases. You can download an online instruction manual, which is a lot more wordy, but it still doesn't explain everything. I found one item in the box that looks like a plastic tab and I cannot find any explanation of its function or where it goes. I just hope I don't ever need it.
4. You get a mounting plate for mounting the vacuum, but I don't know why it's in two parts that snap together with a hinge. I don't know the purpose of the hinge and it makes the mount more fragile so it could break from the weight. The screws they supply for mounting it are about two inches long, which is much much longer than necessary and I had to use two of my own shorter one inch screws to keep them from poking out the back of a wall panel. Also, why does the mounting plate fold?
5. In order to hang up the vacuum using the mounting plate, the battery must be installed. So you can't charge the battery while the vacuum is mounted, unless you have a very nearby outlet and you can't store the battery separately if you want to mount the vacuum.
6. The vacuum cleaner will not stand up on its own. There's no way to let go of it without it falling. You must lay it down or lean it against a corner where it is constrained. While vacuuming the house there are many times you want to pause and leave the vacuum in the current spot, but you must lay it down or find a corner. I don't know if other cordless vacuums have this problem, but I sure wish it could be stood up in an upright position.",,https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Origin-Cordless-Vacuum-Nickel/dp/B00FZPRUTY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=SOUX5UBXI5EN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g3vpa3pw8uT2n-Iy-gNjTfH09ISfCLuJtT5_x-8VuZ8fMfZPsUUaFDpaIMifHEVi0HT0ruPAuG7LgdvpZXIfPNdVrWo5dUHkwxCiXN3B2-r7MkHwfduNiTl3Aed6S3GsIA0adCc-W1BJz0uFgxY-Wj6o7XFTb-WmxXcRiR3rooj5NevAit0M19yp3YhTwlLPIx_dePQFQwwY4rb2_sRtRT4IAB_7v_2Zyq8KuYurBZqza2F0KVPhhjBa9EF89Vx5LB4MN-IS0eUcPFK7GGy9En1e2r5OWUT_sS0tCw76Kqk.eCmjB1i78CAwvDJKdMrndHywG29pSeVzYiYK04NSxvU&dib_tag=se&keywords=dyson&qid=1768774758&sprefix=dyson%2Caps%2C259&sr=8-6&th=1

No light on the front- I really loved that feature with my other vacuum
It says once a week you should drain the battery completely before putting it back onto the charger. So I have to leave it laying on the floor for days each week because I don't need to run it that long at one time.

The charge base should allow for you to plug it up when you want to so this isn't an issue

This is a very beautiful dyson vacuum. We needed an upgrade from our older model. It still doesn't last as long as I would like it to, but still gets the job done. I needed this for upstairs because our older model definitely couldn't handle all three floors of our home. This came with a variety of attachments which are very useful especially the long pointed one for our stairs because lots of crumbs get in the little sides. It does have a bigger container for the dirt so that's really nice. It's also just as loud as our other dyson, so not much help there in terms of noise level. It's tolerable though. It's not like those other vacuums where you REALLY have to yell to hear someone else who is talking to you while vacuuming. I'm also not so bothered about having to hold the trigger while vacuuming because I guess I'm used to it? I mean its not that hard really...I guess it would be nice to not have to do that, but I wouldn't complain about it either way. I love dyson vacuums because my older one has been with us for years now.

I do have some complaints though. This week I used the vacuum 3 days in a row. I ended up a blister between my thumb and index finger. Because there isn't a way to hold the on button.

I took a star off because it's a bit tough to push around on carpets due to the spherical wheels being small. You have to get it at just the right angle for it to glide nicely. The trigger is also really unergonomic, which is surprising, considering the brand. This definitely feels like a blister maker, the way it kinda digs into my first two fingers while pushing around.

It has some trouble picking up ""large"" debris on the floor, stuff like small pebbles or kibble sized bits. Seems to want to fling those around rather than pick them up.

I paid $399. I'd tried the v15 at my office after I made a mess and needed to borrow it from the cleaner. I was impressed and decided to buy one. After watching a lot of reviews, the newer version didn't seem worth the price difference and I decided to get this one. Basically, the suction is not much better on the v15 than this. The battery life is better on the v15 and there are some additional features. If you go much older than the v11, there is a bigger deterioration in suction power, so this version seems like the sweet spot for savings and suction.

The suction on this is great for a cordless and almost as good as my big vacuum. The noise level is impresively low relative to the suction power. I find the long tube very difficult to remove. The charge time is ok and the battery life is pretty good and adequate for my home. The ergonomics are terrible. Even though it's light overall, it's so top heavy that it feels really unpleasant. After using it only a few minutes, my hand starts to ache. I bought a handy little clip to hold the switch in place. It would be even more annoying to use if I had to hold the switch the whole time.

I live in an 800 sf apartment. The Dyson is ok for that and it's good for stairs. I wouldn't want to use it for a large home or as a primary vacuum even in my small apartment. If light weight and portability are a priority for you or you have a bunch of extra money to spend on the convenience of a second vaccum that's cordless, this is good for that. I don't think it's good enough to be a primary vacuum, especially for this kind of money. If I could only afford one floor vacuum for my home, I'd stick with my big old Bissell and get a Dustbuster for stairs and my car.",,https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Origin-Cordless-Vacuum-Nickel/dp/B00FZPRUTY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=SOUX5UBXI5EN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g3vpa3pw8uT2n-Iy-gNjTfH09ISfCLuJtT5_x-8VuZ8fMfZPsUUaFDpaIMifHEVi0HT0ruPAuG7LgdvpZXIfPNdVrWo5dUHkwxCiXN3B2-r7MkHwfduNiTl3Aed6S3GsIA0adCc-W1BJz0uFgxY-Wj6o7XFTb-WmxXcRiR3rooj5NevAit0M19yp3YhTwlLPIx_dePQFQwwY4rb2_sRtRT4IAB_7v_2Zyq8KuYurBZqza2F0KVPhhjBa9EF89Vx5LB4MN-IS0eUcPFK7GGy9En1e2r5OWUT_sS0tCw76Kqk.eCmjB1i78CAwvDJKdMrndHywG29pSeVzYiYK04NSxvU&dib_tag=se&keywords=dyson&qid=1768774758&sprefix=dyson%2Caps%2C259&sr=8-6&th=1

To empty the canister you have to remove the ""stick"" and it is an overall messy process. Also, I repeatedly go an airway blocked message and even after clearing all airways, the message remains. I have even changed the filters multiple times! This is extremely disappointing. I also find this vacuum to be on the louder side (think Dyson hand dryer in a restroom).

BUT, there are two features that need a redesign. (1) put in a real on/off switch instead of the trigger, which is uncomfortable to use for more than 5 minutes. I bought an add-on to keep the trigger down instead of squeezing, which helped immensely, but as someone with large hands, it’s still uncomfortable to use for any length of time since my full hand doesn’t fit. Photo shows add-on trigger switch, but where’s my little finger?? Hint—it doesn’t fit. (2) put the heavy part of the vacuum (the battery and canister) at the bottom to utilize leverage. Vacuuming my whole house (not big—only 1500 sq ft) leaves my elbow and shoulder sore (I’m in my 40s and in decent shape).

Ergonomics are poor on this—it seems clear the designers and testing teams did not use it for more than 5 minutes.

The suction and cleaning head are great; when I first got it I was downright shocked at how much dirt it sucked up from carpets that were as clean as my old plug-in vacuum—which wasn’t terrible—could get them. It definitely has no trouble getting hard floors, low-pile carpet, or medium-pile carpet clean.

It does require a fair amount of force on medium pile carpet, but the brush head auto-adjusts well which is nice. Battery life isn’t great, but is sufficient, so no real complaints there either.

Ergonomically it is fairly heavy, and because all the weight is on the end where the handle is, it feels heavier than it seems like it should. Tolerable, but vacuuming a whole house is definitely a workout compared to a plug-in canister vacuum or upright.

The main problem though is the trigger. For one thing, you need to hold it down to keep the vacuum on, which gets amazingly tiring—my grip is not up to this thing. I eventually bought a little clip-on doodad designed for exactly this—it holds the trigger on for you. But the fact that people are manufacturing add-on trigger locks for these vacuum tells you that the design is fundamentally bad to start with. It’s not, after all, a weedwhacker where having it shut off if you let go is a necessary safety feature—every other vacuum manufactured for the past century or more just switches on and stays on.

Worse still, the interior mechanism of the trigger is not durable, and cracked after a year or so of use, resulting in the vacuum either not turning on or not turning off(!) sporadically. The Internet tells me this is a VERY common failure mode. Worse still, although it’s easy to buy replacement parts here on Amazon (again, how common and readily they are does not speak well to Dyson’s quality), replacing it requires dismantling the entire vacuum—the most fragile part in the device is the hardest to replace.

This switch is so poorly designed, and so hard to repair, that it’s enough to make me into a conspiracy nut believing it’s Dyson’s way of ensuring the vacuum only lasts a couple of years and will be hard enough to repair most people won’t.",,https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Origin-Cordless-Vacuum-Nickel/dp/B00FZPRUTY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=SOUX5UBXI5EN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g3vpa3pw8uT2n-Iy-gNjTfH09ISfCLuJtT5_x-8VuZ8fMfZPsUUaFDpaIMifHEVi0HT0ruPAuG7LgdvpZXIfPNdVrWo5dUHkwxCiXN3B2-r7MkHwfduNiTl3Aed6S3GsIA0adCc-W1BJz0uFgxY-Wj6o7XFTb-WmxXcRiR3rooj5NevAit0M19yp3YhTwlLPIx_dePQFQwwY4rb2_sRtRT4IAB_7v_2Zyq8KuYurBZqza2F0KVPhhjBa9EF89Vx5LB4MN-IS0eUcPFK7GGy9En1e2r5OWUT_sS0tCw76Kqk.eCmjB1i78CAwvDJKdMrndHywG29pSeVzYiYK04NSxvU&dib_tag=se&keywords=dyson&qid=1768774758&sprefix=dyson%2Caps%2C259&sr=8-6&th=1

I had the first Dyson ball when it came out and have always loved Dyson. So I had high expectations for this product as Dyson is a quality brand.

Pros: suction power is good. It is lightweight and easy to maneuver. The different attachments are nice to have and they work well. Easy to charge with the wall mount. Nice and long cord.

Cons: it is a beast to clean. If anything gets clogged it is hard to get unclogged/cleaned out. The floor attachment head gets dirty easily and again, difficult to clean. The way you empty the canister makes it hard to clean inside the canister area.
Installing the wall mount: what. A. Nightmare. For such a high end company, you’d think they’d send quality drywall anchors. No. They sent the cheapest, bottom of the line anchors I’ve ever seen, and I’ve seen a lot. I ended up throwing them away (because they only sent two, no extras, and both of them broke right away), and getting some higher quality ones out of my tool kit. Dyson, do better with your anchoring system. Add in the instructions what size bit to use to drill for the anchors. Have quality anchors, and send at least one extra in case of damaged anchors. You’re hanging up a $500 vacuum, you want it to not fall off your wall.

You have to hold the button down the entire time you’re using it. I have a cheaper one for my RV, and it has a button switch that you push over for keep on. Ergonomically speaking, holding a button down the entire time is not comfortable.

It doesn’t stand on its own. Most stick vacs do. I have a Tineco and the cheaper version and they both stand up on their own with the floor attachments. This does not.

Honestly, my Tineco does just as good of a job, if not better in some areas.",,https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Origin-Cordless-Vacuum-Nickel/dp/B00FZPRUTY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=SOUX5UBXI5EN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g3vpa3pw8uT2n-Iy-gNjTfH09ISfCLuJtT5_x-8VuZ8fMfZPsUUaFDpaIMifHEVi0HT0ruPAuG7LgdvpZXIfPNdVrWo5dUHkwxCiXN3B2-r7MkHwfduNiTl3Aed6S3GsIA0adCc-W1BJz0uFgxY-Wj6o7XFTb-WmxXcRiR3rooj5NevAit0M19yp3YhTwlLPIx_dePQFQwwY4rb2_sRtRT4IAB_7v_2Zyq8KuYurBZqza2F0KVPhhjBa9EF89Vx5LB4MN-IS0eUcPFK7GGy9En1e2r5OWUT_sS0tCw76Kqk.eCmjB1i78CAwvDJKdMrndHywG29pSeVzYiYK04NSxvU&dib_tag=se&keywords=dyson&qid=1768774758&sprefix=dyson%2Caps%2C259&sr=8-6&th=1

So out of the box you get the vacuum itself, 2 different cleaning heads one small and one large, extension wand, multipurpose attachment, crevice tool, charging adapter, cradle to hang the vacuum on a wall, and operating instructions.

The biggest positive for this machine is the power, it has really powerful suction, so this does really well on carpets, pet hair, and bigger messes. Another nice thing is the bigger dust bin, it has a large capacity and I found myself not having to empty it as often like other vacs I have used. The maneuverability is excellent, and it almost lays completely flat making it easier to get under things.

I also found the runtime to be acceptable, with the lowest eco power giving me close to an hour of vacuuming. The charge time was also pretty good, with a fully discharged battery it took between 4 to 5 hours to charge.

Unfortunately this stick is missing key features that I find are must haves. The first thing is the power switch, instead of having a regular on and off switch, you have to hold the button in while you are vacuuming, when you let go of the button the stick stops. This is just annoying, I would rather have a regular button that I can just switch on and off.

One thing that is missing on this unit is a light on the cleaning head, I find that having a light spotlights the dirt and makes it easier to clean up, so that was a major disappointment. Lastly, this unit does not stand on its own so you have to lean it against something so it won't fall. This vac is also pretty top heavy because of the bigger motor, so I would not exactly consider this unit lightweight, not real heavy, but not light.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif

Bumping this down to 2 stars and really sad to do it (look at my initial elation below). I don't totally blame the product but the fact of the matter is I had it for a few months and somehow the cyclone ended up cracked (I have a house with 3 kids and often 2-3+ extra kids).... it is far more delicate than it should be IMHO. The cyclone plastic is like eggshell thickness.. couldn't believe it. Dyson's answer to our ask for help was to want $120 more for a cyclone unit. My husband probably could fix the unit if they gave the individual part that broke but they don't sell that. So here we are 3 months in with a BRICK. I don't really find that acceptable for an item they are asking $450-650 for on here. I really wish i started out with a refurb unit that costs half as much. We cannot afford to pay this much for a vacuum and then pay that much to repair 3 months later. Old shark corded vac lasted over 5 years and is now being put back into use.... let that speak for itself.

ORIGINAL:
My wife really enjoyed her corded shark and didn't see the point in getting one of these......... Now she freely admits that she loves it. It is so convenient that there is no reason NOT to vacuum up the little messes. Hung it in the hallway and grab it many times when i walk past. Our dogs make little ""tumbleweeds"" of hair... no more do i have to cringe seeing them accumulate in a corner. The attachments are awesome and i used the ol 3d printer to make additional mounts (and soon other attachments too). Cord length for the charger was pretty much perfect for us. The dustbin is of a good size to hold a full sweeping session and be dumped out (which is also super convenient once you get used to it. This thing is super handy.... I've even taken to using it on our deck. A use case a lot of people don't think about... sucking up carpenter bees and wasps. I can suck up those buggers with little risk of getting bit/stung.

This thing is 100% worth the money, so long as it lasts a few more years. My wife has already dropped it a couple times and it's held up just fine so I have faith.

Bonus: even the kids have fun running the vacuum now. It's crazy how just removing a cord from something takes it form being a mundane task to a fun one. Can you tell I really like this thing?",,https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Origin-Cordless-Vacuum-Nickel/dp/B00FZPRUTY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=SOUX5UBXI5EN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g3vpa3pw8uT2n-Iy-gNjTfH09ISfCLuJtT5_x-8VuZ8fMfZPsUUaFDpaIMifHEVi0HT0ruPAuG7LgdvpZXIfPNdVrWo5dUHkwxCiXN3B2-r7MkHwfduNiTl3Aed6S3GsIA0adCc-W1BJz0uFgxY-Wj6o7XFTb-WmxXcRiR3rooj5NevAit0M19yp3YhTwlLPIx_dePQFQwwY4rb2_sRtRT4IAB_7v_2Zyq8KuYurBZqza2F0KVPhhjBa9EF89Vx5LB4MN-IS0eUcPFK7GGy9En1e2r5OWUT_sS0tCw76Kqk.eCmjB1i78CAwvDJKdMrndHywG29pSeVzYiYK04NSxvU&dib_tag=se&keywords=dyson&qid=1768774758&sprefix=dyson%2Caps%2C259&sr=8-6&th=1

I paid $315 for the refurbished model. I should've gotten the cheapest one available. This was no deal.

Emptying the canister is disgusting. The way you slide it down to dispel everything you picked up is a terrible design. No matter what if you want the canister as empty as you can get it you must reach your hand up and try to grab the remainder with your fingers.

The most common complaint was having to hold down the ""on"" trigger while you vacuum. This has been a non issue for me. However the biggest issue is that the vacuum head containing the brush lifts while vacuuming requiring you push it back down with your foot constantly. I purchased it because of the claims about how well it picks up dog hair and won't clog. Not entirely true...It traps dog hair between the inner and outer cannisters which is a huge ordeal to get what I can out when emptying it. It also won't pick up things like pieces of sticks which my dog brings in due to the entrance into the cannister is small and won't allow passage-same for bigger clumps of dog hair. I had such high hopes and am highly disappointed. If my son had not thrown the box away I would return it for a refund and order a shark which is what I had previously.

I really love how easy it is to use and how little space it takes.

These are the problems though:

1. I've only had this vacuum for 7 months and a part cracked and broke off. I go to the Dyson website and the part is out of stock with no estimate of when it's going to be back in stock (I contacted their chat). I was not able to use the warranty until the part is back in stock. To me, that seems like this part breaks a lot so that's why it's out of stock. Not sure though.
2. It does not pick up very good. It's suction, even at the highest level, is not great. I have to go over and over just to make sure it picks up all the crumbs.
3. It will only pick up small crumbs. Any slightly big pieces (like part of popcorn) will get stuck and you have to push it out.

The number one problem is what concerns me the most. For this price, a vacuum should not be cracking and breaking after 7 months of use. It was getting more and more wobbly until it cracked all the way. The part I'm talking about is the long extension part, specifically the piece that connects to the vacuum holder. I will update my review if the part comes back in stock and I'm able to use the warranty. If I can't use the warranty because they didn't get the part restocked, I will go down to 1 star.

The battery is wonderful. I love the convenience of being able to grab it and scoot all around my house. Unfortunately I live on a dirt road and I have three German shepherds and it cannot keep up with daily vacuuming. It gets clogged very easily at the top and I have to take it apart and pull out giant chunks of dog hair to unclog it, put it together, run it so the next clogs come to the top, then repeat the process again and again till clear. Also all the dust and the dirt on the floor clogs up the filters quickly and I have to continuously blow them out with an air compressor on a weekly basis to get it to actually run at high suction. If not, it'll only let me run on low and medium suction, and let's be honest, nobody's going to use low suction. Lastly, the plastic case that holds all the dirt is not very sturdy and it is already cracked in several places. This is my second Dyson stick vacuum. The first one several years ago did the same thing. I ended up switching to a Shop-Vac which was amazing but much harder to use around the house.

The good:
They work REALLY well right out of the box.
They work really well for about 3-5 months.
Cordless. Good suction (when it’s new)
10/10 when it’s new honestly, seems like a dream come true vacuum.

The bad:
Pretty useless after 5 solid months of use.
Even at full charge, it doesn’t last more than a couple minutes.
Complete loss of suction, even after a thorough deep clean and de-dusting. Won’t even suck up a single piece of fine thin human hair off the carpet, or hardwood floors.
Doesn’t work at all on the highest power (machine shuts off, or goes off and on before powering off)

This happened with my first Dyson cordless but I figured since it was an older model the newer one wouldn’t do the same thing right? Wrong. Same exact issues.

I won’t ever buy another Dyson cordless vacuum even though I still love Dyson products.

I was hoping, since I paid substantially more for it than others that it would function substantially better. Compared to other cordless vacuums, it may have slightly better suction but only when using the boost feature and it drains your battery fast. The other part that disappoints me is the cheapness and the difficulty with how it should detach... not just to empty, but also in removing the extention tube and the floor cleaning head and carpet cleaning head. I struggle w it every time to remove it. And you have to remove it when emptying the bagless canister. I've even been pinched and scraped leaving gashes and blood blisters. Also, The location of the air exit vents for the exhaust not only blows debris all over the room but when you vacuum overhead it blows right in your face.

The vacuum comes with a generous selection of attachments, which initially seemed promising.
However, our experience quickly soured due to several design flaws. The most frustrating issue is the need to hold down the trigger continuously while vacuuming. This makes using attachments—especially the hose—awkward and uncomfortable. While Dyson claims this feature helps conserve battery life, it feels like the design team may not have considered real-world usage.
To make matters worse, the plastic above the trigger is misaligned and scratches your skin, making extended cleaning sessions unpleasant. We discovered that you can buy an after-market trigger lock, but it’s disappointing to spend this much money and then need additional accessories just to make the vacuum usable.
Compared to our previous $100 vacuum, which included a light and a hardwood floor attachment, this Dyson model falls short. The only way to get a hardwood floor attachment is to purchase another after-market device.

Nordstrom,I don't love it.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2025",,"I wanted to love this. I have an earlier model that has run like a champ and has had zero issues. My husband wanted to donate it to a local church that needed it and thought I would love an upgrade. When this came up on Prime Days, I was thrilled to order it. I am soooo disappointed. I mean, when a company makes a new model of something, they should really try to improve on things.
I'll start with the good, since not everything is bad about it. It has good suction. I like that it is easy to tell how much battery life is left on it. The new carpet head is nice.

And now for the not so good... It's heavy. The top of it is longer and heavier than my previous one. I mean, I guess this could be beneficial since my biceps are getting a work out, but it really is fatiguing. Hair gets spun around the cylindrical thing at the top of the dust bin. I mean, invested in a small brush just to get it out. The small head that comes with the vacuum doesn't swivel and is difficult to use on stairs. It didn't come with a specific hard wood attachment like my previous one - so I am glad I kept my old one. It still doesn't have a light on the vacuum head. I know the higher end model does, but that will cost a few hundred more dollars. The dust bin is not as easy to operate - and then when closing it, it doesn't always stay.

I would love to return this and just get the cheaper version that I have again, but it's no longer on sale. So, for now I will keep this one, but I will be on the hunt for a better solution.

The vacuum itself is okay, but honestly not the best for the money. It does the job, but for the price point, I expected stronger performance and better overall value.

What really disappointed me, though, was the pricing strategy. The Cyber Monday “deal” felt misleading — more like a marketing tactic to rush people into buying rather than a real discount. For a company as big as Dyson, this felt cheap and frustrating.

Mine came with a defective vacuum head ball which helps it to move around. Hopefully they are sending me another but right now I have to push it with my foot to make it lay flat to slide under chairs, etc.

It does a great job of vacuuming though. However, I think it's way overpriced. I have a Britech that is lighter, has a light, the head is narrow and is so easy to move everywhere, and the basket is easy to empty.

I was happy with it until it started to malfunction about a month ago (ca14 months since purchase). The replacement part was $130! But wait … no warries, Dyson has a 2-year warranty. Yah! The ever ‘friendly’ Dyson customer service (e.g., “apologize for the inconvenience caused to you” or “appreciate your understanding and patience” etc.) informed me that: ""As we checked the proof of purchase the machine is not eligible for a replacement part as we checked the purchase invoice it is written there sold by wacky jacks.” WHO?? First, I never heard of this company, I bought the Dyson from Amazon, as far as I am concerned … but apparently not. The product came from this third-party seller Wacky Jacky in NJ. So, buyer beware who the third-party sellers are!
I’m super disappoint that a) such an expensive equipment broke down so quickly, and b) that Dyson customer service is so bad. They don’t respect the FTC’s (Federal Trade Commission) law which states that “It’s generally not legal for a company to void a warranty or deny coverage simply because a product was purchases from a third-party vendor.” Lawsuits have been won based on that law. Hope Dyson is next. I reported them to ReportFraud.ftc.gov.

I installed that and have the same issue with the new part so in essence there is something wrong with the model itself. Dyson's only solution is for me to ship this one back and they will send me another model because they don't make this one any longer. They say that I have to wait up to 15 days.

Well, the warranty is worthless.

I received my Dyson V11 stick vacuum recently and registered it right away. After using it a few times, the motorbar head is making a loud vibrating noise while using it on wood floors. I submitted a warranty ticket online and explained my issue.

After a long time, I received a form email asking me to troubleshoot. I already did this and replied right away. After another long wait, I received an email saying they understand my V8 (mine is V11) won't turn on. There was nothing in my communications about it not turning on.

The email also said that the motorbar head is not intended for bare floors even though the product page has ""Motorbar cleaner head deep cleans all floor types"". There is even a photo of a woman using the motorbar head on both wood and carpet.

I replied and said nothing they stated makes sense. Now, I am getting radio silence.
